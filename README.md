Hello, all! My soundscape has slowly transformed into a podcast-type narrative, where I mainly focus on a conversation with my roommate Jen and her outlook on the job market as a senior in 2021 and during COVID. As I continued clipping the interview, I realized it would be more beneficial to include my own voice as well, considering I don't have plans/goals nearly as defined as I learned that she does. Neither of us have any solid plans at the moment, so I really tried to hone in on that feeling of anxiety.
